        <p>
          Welcome to the Birth and Early Parenting Resource Directory! We
          understand that the journey to parenthood is a transformative one,
          filled with both joys and challenges. Our directory is designed to
          connect expecting and new parents with resources in our community,
          including doulas for expert birth guidance, lactation consultants for
          nurturing breastfeeding/chestfeeding experiences, and perinatal mental
          health care professionals for emotional well-being. Whether you're
          embarking on the adventure of parenthood for the first time or
          expanding your family, our aim is to ease the process of navigating
          this remarkable life chapter.

        <p>
          Currently, this directory focuses on three essential categories of
          care: doula services, lactation support, and perinatal mental health
          care. This selection is based on our surveys of expecting and new
          parents' core needs during pregnancy, birth, and early childhood. As
          this project grows, we hope to add more types of care and resources
          for pregnancy, birth, and early parenting.
